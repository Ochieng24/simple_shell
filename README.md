Project Title:Simple Shell

Description:A simple shell is a command-line interpreter that serves as a basic interface for users to interact with an operating system. It allows users to enter commands and execute them, providing a way to navigate directories, run programs, and manage processes. The shell supports functionalities like input/output redirection, allowing users to redirect input from or output to files. It also includes built-in commands for common operations such as changing the current directory or exiting the shell. Overall, a simple shell provides a straightforward and accessible means for users to interact with the underlying operating system through a command-line interface

Features:A simple shell typically offers several key features that facilitate command-line interaction with an operating system. These features include command execution, allowing users to run various commands and programs. Input/output redirection enables the redirection of input from files or output to files. Background process management allows users to run processes in the background, freeing up the shell for additional commands. Additionally, simple shells often include support for built-in commands, such as changing directories or exiting the shell. These features collectively provide users with a basic yet functional command-line environment for executing commands, managing processes, and manipulating input/output streams.

Getting Started:To set up and run the shell on a local machine, a few prerequisites and installation instructions need to be followed. First, ensure that the target operating system is compatible with the shell. Next, install the required programming language and ensure it is properly configured. Identify any dependencies or additional libraries needed by the shell and install them on the system. To start, clone the shell project repository from Git and navigate to the project directory. If necessary, compile the shell source code or run any build commands specific to the project. Finally, execute the shell executable to start using the shell. It is crucial to ensure that all dependencies and libraries required by the shell are correctly installed and accessible on the local machine to avoid any runtime issues.

Usage:The usage of a simple shell involves interacting with the command-line interface to execute various commands and perform operations. Users can enter commands directly into the shell prompt and press Enter to execute them. The shell will then interpret and execute the command, displaying the output or performing the desired action. Users can navigate directories, run programs, manage processes, and utilize features such as input/output redirection or executing commands in the background by appending an ampersand symbol (&). The shell may also support built-in commands for tasks like changing directories or exiting the shell. Overall, the usage of a simple shell revolves around entering commands and utilizing its features to interact with the underlying operating system.
